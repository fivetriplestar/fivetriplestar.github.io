## 5 Triple Star

Hi here! This is the official home page of the `5-triple-star` project.

Currently, this project is still under construction. After we have completed a decent amount of content on some topic, there will be a release (in `pdf` format).
Links to released material can be found in the Released Material part.

Under-construction material (```tex``` and related files) can be found [here in the repo](https://github.com/mklprudence/5-triple-star).
